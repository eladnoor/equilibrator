Thioester Bonds are Energetic Too
==========================================================

Phosphoanhydride bonds like those in ATP are not the only energy-carrying bonds used by biology. In fact, phosphate was likely scarce during the early history of Earth and some researchers hypothesize that thioester bonds - bonds between a sulfur and a carbonyl carbon (R–S–CO–R') - were used as energy currency during the evolution of early life (Goldford et al.).

So how much energy is there in a thioester bond? We can use eQuilibrator to examine the hydrolysis of the common biological thioester, acetyl-CoA

Acetyl-CoA + H\ :sub:`2`\ O <=> Acetate + CoA

We find that this hydrolysis reaction has a ΔrG'm around -40 kJ/mol - very similar to the energetic scale of ATP hydrolysis. In fact, the thioester bond is sometimes exchanged with a phosphoester bond (like the one in ATP) during metabolism of acetyl-CoA

Acetyl-CoA + Pi <=> Acetyl-phosphate + CoA

Notice that this reaction has a positive ΔrG'm  ≈ 10 kJ/mol, meaning that it would flow in the reverse direction (forming acetyl-CoA) if all the reactants had 1 mM concentrations. However, concentrations are of course not exactly 1 mM in cells. Cellular concentrations of inorganic phosphate are, for example, typically closer to 10 mM (e.g. for E. coli see BNID 105540). 

Try using eQuilibrator to set the phosphate concentration to 10 mM, leaving everything else at 1 mM. Notice that the ΔrG'm value changed by about 6 kJ/mol. As an exercise: show with some simple math that a 10-fold change in one reactant concentration will always alter the ΔrG' by about 6 kJ/mol (hint: think about the formula for ΔrG' = ΔrG'° + RT ln Q).
