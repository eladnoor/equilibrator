Energy Currency and ATP Hydrolysis 
==========================================================

ATP is considered the energy "currency" of the cell. But how much is that currency worth? How much energy is in an ATP hydrolysis reaction? The hydrolysis of one phosphoanhydride bond to form ADP and phosphate

`ATP + H2O ⇌ ADP + Pi <http://equilibrator.weizmann.ac.il/search?query=ATP+%2B+Water+%3C%3D%3E+ADP+%2B+Phosphate>`_

has a ΔrG'° of about -26 kJ / mol. That is, if you hydrolyze 1 mol of ATP to ADP in standard conditions, 26 kJ of energy that is usable for work is released. Conversely, it takes 26 kJ of work to form 1 mol of ATP from ADP in standard conditions.

Keep in mind that ΔrG'° is defined in standard conditions (1 molar concentrations) while biological concentrations are much closer to 1 millimolar (1 mM). Try using eQuilibrator to figure out the ΔrG' of ATP hydrolysis in these conditions (answer: ~44 kJ / mol). 

We can also convert this value into other units, for example units of mechanical force relevant on the molecular scale: piconewton nanometers (pN nm). Looking up the definitions of these units, we find that 1 pN nm = 10-24 kJ and so 1 pN nm / mol = 0.6 kJ / mol. This gives us roughly 73 pN nm per ATP hydrolysis (Phillips et al., 2009). But how much energy is that? Well, it’s more than enough to `compact DNA <http://bionumbers.hms.harvard.edu/bionumber.aspx?id=103125>`_ into a viral capsid, for example. In other words, ATP stores an amount of energy that can be converted into a usable amount of work at the molecular scale. ATP acts as a bridge between the chemical and physical realms - between energy metabolism and the mechanical work of living.
