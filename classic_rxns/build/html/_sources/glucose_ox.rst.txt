The Oxidation of Glucose
==========================================================

With glucose being on of the most common sugars in the biosphere (and certainly the most common in labs), the oxidation of glucose is a major source of chemical energy for many organisms. This process - the conservation of energy through complete oxidation of glucose using oxygen - is called “respiration.” Much of the energy harvested from glucose oxidation is stored as ATP. If we take a look at the full oxidation of glucose to carbon dioxide and water

Glucose + 6 O2 ⇌ 6 CO2 + 6 H\ :sub:`2`\ O

we find that ΔrG'° is about -2930 kJ / mol. In this case the effect of correcting for a more typical biological concentration of 1 mM is almost negligible, ΔrG' ≈ -2910 kJ / mol. According to our calculation from above, that's enough energy to make 66 ATP (in theory). But most organisms generate 30 ATP or less through the oxidization of glucose (Nelson et al., 2008; Flamholz et al., 2014).

Biochemistry textbooks often write this pathway as generating 36 ATP

Glucose + 6 O2 + 36 ADP + 36 Pi ⇌ 6 CO2 + 42 H\ :sub:`2`\ O + 36 ATP

giving a ΔrG' of around -1350 kJ / mol (when all concentrations are 1 mM). In other words, there's more free energy! Which begs the question: why not make more ATP? If you're interested in learning more, consider looking up "chemical motive force" for reversible reactions.
