What's new in eQuilibrator 2.1?
==========================================================

* The **uncertainty** of each estimation is now provided. For example, when we write Δ\ :sub:`r`\ G'° = -32.1 ± **1.4** [kJ/mol], the 1.4 represents a 95% confidence interval around the estimated Gibbs energy. This change was facilitated by upgrading our software to the more precise Component Contribution method.
* A dedicated page for **reduction potentials** (see for example `Oxaloacetate reduction </search?query=oxaloacetate+%3D+L-malate>`_).
* Gas, liquid and solid phase for the relevant compounds (e.g. you can use O\ :sub:`2`\ (g) and CO\ :sub:`2`\ (g) in `glucose oxidation </search?query=Glucose+%2B+6+O2%28g%29+%3D+6+CO2%28g%29+%2B+6+H2O>`_).
* A fresh design and LOTS of usability upgrades.
* Substantially faster search powered by `Solr <http://lucene.apache.org/solr/>`_.
* Thermodynamic `analysis of metabolic pathways </pathway>`_ using the `MDF </static/classic_rxns/faq.html#what-is-the-mdf-of-a-pathway>`_.
* A `new primer </static/classic_rxns/index.html>`_ on studying classic metabolic reactions using eQuilibrator.
