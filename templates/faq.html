                <div class="faqAnswer">
                <p>You can search for a compound or enzyme by entering their common name into the search box.
                For example, try "<a href="/search?query=Succinyl-CoA">Succinyl-CoA</a>" or
                "<a href="/search?query=pyruvate+formate-lyase">pyruvate formate-lyase</a>."
                As you type, you should see a list of potential matches which should give you a sense of
                what eQuilibrator thinks you are looking for. To the right of each suggestion you will
                see they type of the match: "Compound" or "Enzyme".
                
                  Complete your search by selecting a compound or enzyme from the list or typing the
                  name in full. When you've finished typing your query, click 'Search' or press
                  'Enter' to see search results.
                  </p>
                
                <p>
                The search results page shows the top matches for your query. Results are shown in two
                sections: one for compounds and another for enzymes. If you're interested in a compound,
                click on it to see more details and to find &Delta;<sub>f</sub>G.
                If you're interested in an enzyme, click on the enzyme name to see
                detailed information about it. If you want to explore the thermodynamics of an
                enzyme-catalyzed reaction, choose a reaction listed under the enzyme name to get
                a &Delta;<sub>r</sub>G estimation.

                <div class="faqAnswer">
                <p>You can search for a reaction by entering an (almost) free-text string of the reaction.
                For example, you can type
                "<a href="/search?query=glucose+%3D+2+ethanol+%2B+2+co2">glucose = 2 ethanol + 2 co2</a>".</p>
                
                <p>In general, write your reaction using " = " or " &lt;=&gt; " to separate the substrates from the products.
                The spaces around " = " are required. Always use spaces before and after compound names, "+"
                and stoichiometric coefficients.</p>
                
                <p>
                Also note that it is possible to find reactions through the enzymes that catalyze them.
                For example, instead of typing in the full reaction
                "<a href="/search?query=Fructose+1%2C6-bisphosphate+%3D+Glycerone+phosphate+%2B+Glyceraldehyde+3-phosphate">Fructose 1,6-bisphosphate = Glycerone phosphate + Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate</a>"
                you can instead search for "<a href="/search?query=aldolase">aldolase</a>" or

            <div class="faqEntry" id="gases">
                <div class="faqQuestion">How do you deal with gases like O<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>?
                How can I set for standard conditions in reactions involving a gas?</div>
                
                <div class="faqAnswer">
                <p>For gases the standard condition is defined as 1 atmosphere partial pressure.
                In eQuilibrator because we deal with aqueous reactions we only use soluble
                concentrations (i.e. 1M). Thus one should be careful in using reactions involving gases.
                If one knows the soluble concentration of the gas of interest it should be
                specified by choosing "custom" concentrations. For example, the solubility of
                O<sub>2</sub> in water with the normal atmospheric content of about 20% is approximately 200&mu;M
                (value varies with temperature).</p><p>
                If you are interested in getting the standard conditions that relate to the 1
                atmosphere partial pressure condition you have to specify the corresponding
                soluble concentration that can be derived through <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry's_law">Henry's law</a>.

                <div class="faqQuestion">What are &Delta;<sub>r</sub>G&deg;, &Delta;<sub>r</sub>G'&deg; and &Delta;<sub>r</sub>G'?</div>
            
                <div class="faqAnswer">
                    <p>G is the Gibbs free energy of a physical system.
                    It quantifies the amount of energy available for work in a system that is 
                    at constant temperature and pressure. Biological systems do not often
                    experience radical changes in temperature or pressure, so G is appropriate
                    for their analysis. On eQuilibrator we assume that the temperature is
                    25 &deg;C (298.15 Kelvin) and the pressue is 1 bar. As a consequence of the
                    second law of thermodynamics, spontaneous changes in systems at constant temperature and pressure
                    must lead to a reduction in G. Chemical reactions change biochemical systems,
                    so the same must be true of them: in order to occur, a reaction must lead
                    to a reduction in the Gibbs free energy - &Delta;<sub>r</sub>G' &lt; 0.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>&Delta;<sub>r</sub>G&deg; is the change in Gibbs free energy due to a 
                    chemical reaction in standard conditions and without accounting for pH,
                    ionic strength or any other cellular factors (i.e. they are taken as 0).
                    &Delta;<sub>r</sub>G'&deg; is the change in Gibbs free energy due to a
                    chemical reaction due a reaction at a particular pH and ionic strength.
                    These are convenient reference points, but neither &Delta;<sub>r</sub>G&deg;
                    nor &Delta;<sub>r</sub>G'&deg; account for the effect of reactant
                    concentrations on the free energy.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>In cells there are certain prevailing metabolite concentrations. 
                    Concentrations affect the entropic component of the free energy:
                    if substrate concentrations are higher than product concentrations then
                    forward flow of the reaction will balance the concentrations and increase 
                    the entropy of the system. &Delta;<sub>r</sub>G' accounts for the effect
                    of concentrations. It is very important to use &Delta;<sub>r</sub>G' values
                    derived from physiologically plausible concentrations in thermodynamic analysis
                    because reactant concentrations have a substantial effect on &Delta;<sub>r</sub>G'
                    and because the laws of thermodynamics constrain only &Delta;<sub>r</sub>G',
                    not &Delta;<sub>r</sub>G&deg; or &Delta;<sub>r</sub>G'&deg;.

                <div class="faqAnswer">
                    <p>The formation energy of a compound is the change in free energy due to the
                    compound's formation reaction - the reaction forming it from elements in their
                    standard form. For example, the formation reaction of carbon dioxide is
                    O<sub>2</sub> + C &rlhar; CO<sub>2</sub>. &Delta;<sub>f</sub>G&deg; is the
                    formation energy of a compound in standard conditions and without accounting for pH,
                    ionic strength or any other cellular factors (i.e. they are taken as 0).

                    <p>In contrast, &Delta;<sub>f</sub>G'&deg; is the formation energy of a compound
                    at a particular set of cellular conditions. When we show a &Delta;<sub>f</sub>G'&deg;
                    on eQuilibrator, as we do on compound and reaction pages, it has been transformed 
                    to the pH and ionic strength values. The default pH is 7 and the default ionic strength
                    is 0.1 mM.

                <div class="faqQuestion">What does the 'm' in  &Delta;<sub>r</sub>G'<sup>m</sup>, &Delta;<sub>f</sub>G'<sup>m</sup>, and E'<sup>m</sup> mean?</div>
            
                <div class="faqAnswer">
                    <p>
                    As explained in our explanation about <a href="#dgr">&Delta;<sub>r</sub>G'</a>, 
                    the reaction Gibbs energy depends on the concentrations of the reactants 
                    (and similarly for the formation energy &Delta;<sub>f</sub>G' and the reduction 
                    potential E'). It is useful to have a standard for these 
                    concentrations in order to compare between reactions without the need to specify 
                    a concentration explicitly. The standard used almost exclusively for compounds in
                    solution is 1M. However, we believe that in the context of metabolic reactions which
                    occur inside living cells, it is more relevant to use 1mM as the standard since
                    the concentrations of even the smallest metabolites typically are in the 1nM-10mM
                    range. 1M is by far much higher than any physiologically feasible concentration.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    The notation for the reaction Gibbs energy in the standard 1M concentrations
                    is &Delta;<sub>r</sub>G'&deg;, i.e.
                    the degree sign (&deg;) represents 1M. For our physiological standard
                    we use the superscript 'm' to mark the 1mM concentration that is used for all
                    reactants: &Delta;<sub>r</sub>G'<sup>m</sup>, &Delta;<sub>f</sub>G'<sup>m</sup>, and E'<sup>m</sup>.

            <div class="faqEntry" id="notAvailable">
                <div class="faqQuestion">Why is &Delta;G "not available?"</div>
                
                <div class="faqAnswer">
                <p>There are several reasons that a &Delta;G value might not be available.</p>
                
                <p>In the case of a reaction, &Delta;<sub>r</sub>G is not available when
                &Delta;<sub>f</sub>G is missing for one of the reactants.
                &Delta;<sub>f</sub>G is very difficult to measure experimentally. We use the group contribution
                method to estimate &Delta;<sub>f</sub>G for compounds that have not been characterized experimentally [3-4].
                However, we need certain data about a compound in order to approximate &Delta;<sub>f</sub>G.</p>

                <p>Our list of compounds is taken from the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genomes and Genes (<a href="http://www.kegg.jp">KEGG</a>) [5].
                Occasionally, KEGG compound entries don't contain an InChI identifier. Without an InChI identifier we cannot 
                compute the structure of the compound and without structural information we can't estimate &Delta;<sub>f</sub>G.</p>
                
                <p>In some cases, a compound may contain a chemical group that was not observed in any of the compounds that have experimental
                &Delta;<sub>f</sub>G measurements. We cannot produce estimates for these compounds as we cannot estimate the contribution
                of unknown groups. In other cases, our algorithm for analyzing compound structure fails to decompose the compound
                into groups. If we are unable to decompose the compound then we cannot use the group contribution method.</p>
                
                <p>Moreover, we can't estimate &Delta;<sub>r</sub>G for any reaction that contains a compound that we cannot estimate
                &Delta;<sub>f</sub>G for.</p>

                <div class="faqQuestion">How do you calculate the uncertainty for each estimation</div>
                <div class="faqAnswer">
                <p>In order to fully understand how to calculate estimation uncertainties, you'll
                probably need to read our paper on the Component Contribution method [6]. The short
                answer would be that we ran a cross-validation benchmark using a set of reactions for which the
                &Delta;<sub>r</sub>G' has been measured. Any reaction that you type in, is decomposed into
                compounds and these compounds are decomposed into groups. By comparing this decomposition
                vector with the ones from our database, we can estimate the &Delta;<sub>r</sub>G'. Along
                the way, we can also evaluate how good our estimation is, by checking how good we were
                for similar reactions in our benchmark.

                <p>The temperature is fixed at 25 &deg;C (298.15 K) for all &Delta;G values given.
                
                The group contribution method enables us to approximate &Delta;<sub>f</sub>G of compounds at
                a particular temperature (the temperature at which they were measured) [4]. As the change in free energy
                is defined as &Delta;G = &Delta;H - T&Delta;S and we don't know the value of &Delta;S in most cases, we
                cannot predict how changes in temperature will affect &Delta;<sub>f</sub>G.

            <div class="faqQuestion">What are CO<sub>2</sub>(aq) and CO<sub>2</sub>(total)?</div>
            
            <div class="faqAnswer">
            <p>CO<sub>2</sub>(aq) is dissolved CO<sub>2</sub>. Dissolved CO<sub>2</sub> undergoes a spontaneous hydration reaction:</p>
            
            <p>
            CO<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O &rlhar; H<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>
            </p>
            
            <p>The rate of the uncatalyzed hydration reaction is t<sub>1/2</sub> = 15 seconds. In some
            species this reaction is catalyzed by the enzyme carbonic anhydrase, which speeds it up
            by a factor of 10<sup>6</sup> [6]. In aqueous environments, CO<sub>2</sub> is generally considered to be
            in equilibrium with its hydrated forms - carbonic acid, bicarbonate and carbonate. CO2(total)
            represents the collection of species including dissolved CO<sub>2</sub> (CO<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O)
            and its 3 hydrated forms (H<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>, HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>
            and CO<sub>3</sub><sup>2-</sup>). Note that CO<sub>2</sub>(total) contains a water molecule in addition to
            CO2<sub>2</sub>.</p>
            
            <p>
            It is generally simpler to measure the concentration of CO<sub>2</sub>(total) than it is to measure
            the individual species. As such, it is common to apply the equilibrium assumption and use
            CO<sub>2</sub>(total) in place of CO<sub>2</sub>(aq) in biochemical reactions. If you can measure the concentration
            of CO<sub>2</sub>(aq), then it is reasonable to use it as a reactant.

            <div class="faqQuestion">What is a "Half-reaction"?</div>
            
            <div class="faqAnswer">
            <p>
            A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-reaction">half-reaction</a> 
            can be the oxidation or reduction component of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox">
            redox reaction</a>, without the
            other component. When you search for such a reaction, eQuilibrator recognizes that the number of
            electrons is not balanced and automatically switches to 'half-reaction' mode. Without knowing the other
            half, the change in Gibbs energy is not well defined. The parameter that is used to describe the
            potential difference (in Volts) between the products and substrates of a half-reaction is called
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox_reaction#Standard_electrode_potentials_.28reduction_potentials.29">
            redox potential</a> and is marked by E'&deg;. The redox
            potential is equal to the voltage at equilibrium under standard
            conditions of an electrochemical cell in which the cathode reaction is the half-reaction considered,
            and the anode is a standard hydrogen electrode where hydrogen is oxidized: 
            1/2 H<sub>2</sub> &rlhar; H<sup>+</sup> + e<sup>-</sup>.
            </p>
            <p>
            Assuming you do want to get the Gibbs energy of a reaction, you have two options. You can either
            balance the electrons in the half-reaction by completing the other half (we make it easy for you
            by providing a link for balancing with NAD<sup>+</sup>/NADH). Or, you could use the bottom panel
            in the results table to adjust the potential of the electrons in the reaction (i.e. change
            the value of e<sup>-</sup> potential [mV]). This is useful in cases where the half-reaction is coupled
            to an electron transfer for which the redox potential is known, but the compounds themselves are not,
            or they are too complex to use in eQuilibrator (e.g. protein complexes or membranal electron transport
            chains).
