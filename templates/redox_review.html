	        <p>
	        Redox reactions are a special case of biochemical reactions, where electrons are transferred from one compound to another.
	        It is common to consider the compound which looses the electrons and consequently changes to its oxidized form as the
	        electron donor, and the compound which gains electrons and changes to its reduced form as the electron acceptor.
	        For example, in the reaction
              <a href="/reaction?query=L-Malate+%2B+NAD%2B+%3D+Oxaloacetate+%2B+NADH&reactantsCoeff=-1&reactantsId=C00149&reactantsName=L-Malate&reactantsConcentration=1&reactantsConcentrationPrefactor=0.001&reactantsPhase=aqueous&reactantsCoeff=-1&reactantsId=C00003&reactantsName=NAD%2B&reactantsConcentration=1&reactantsConcentrationPrefactor=0.001&reactantsPhase=aqueous&reactantsCoeff=1&reactantsId=C00036&reactantsName=Oxaloacetate&reactantsConcentration=1&reactantsConcentrationPrefactor=0.001&reactantsPhase=aqueous&reactantsCoeff=1&reactantsId=C00004&reactantsName=NADH&reactantsConcentration=1&reactantsConcentrationPrefactor=0.001&reactantsPhase=aqueous">
              L-malate + NAD<sup>+</sup> &rlhar; oxaloacetate + NADH</a>,
	        L-malate is the electron donor and is oxidized to oxaloacetate. NAD<sup>+</sup> is the electron acceptor and is reduced to NADH.
	        Since all of the reactants are soluble metabolites with explicit chemical formulas, one can calculate their formation
	        energies and use them to deduce the &Delta;G of the reaction like in any other biochemical reaction.
	        </p>
	        
	        <p>
	        There are several compounds that are used mainly for electron transfer. They are called electron carriers or redox carriers.
	        For example, the pair NAD<sup>+</sup>:NADH, NADP<sup>+</sup>:NADPH, and ubiquinone:ubiquinol are all common electron donors or acceptors in many redox reactions.
	        Since they are not chemically involved in these reactions (except by electron transfer) it is useful to define their standard reduction potential
	        (E&deg;) which reflects the affinity of the oxidized form for electrons (calculated assuming that H<sub>2</sub> is the electron donor).
	        Electrons tend to flow from a lower potential to a higher one. In biological systems, it is common to define the reduction potential at a specific pH, denoted E'&deg;. 
	        </p>
	        
	        <p>
	        The reduction potential of NAD<sup>+</sup>:NADH is E'&deg; = -330 mV and the reduction potential of &frac12;O<sub>2</sub>:H<sub>2</sub>O is more than 800 mV.
	        Therefore, electrons will tend to flow from NADH to O<sub>2</sub> producing NAD<sup>+</sup> and H<sub>2</sub>O. As a brief aside, note that we make no effort 
	        to balance protons (H<sup>+</sup>). Protons are be drawn from the aqueous environment and their potential is dictated by the pH.
	        </p>
	        
	        <p>
	  		Reduction potentials can be defined and measured for any electron source or sink, not only for soluble electron carriers.
	  		However, when a reaction involves only soluble electron carriers, performing calculations using reduction potentials is equivalent to using the
	  		change in &Delta;G'&deg; of formation of the oxidized and reduced forms. The equation for converting E'&deg; to &Delta;G'&deg;
	  		is: &Delta;G'&deg; = -nF∙&Delta;E'&deg;, where n is the number of electrons transferred, and F is Faraday's constant that represents the charge
	  		of 1 mol of electrons or 9.65∙104 C∙mol<sup>-1</sup>. For example, the &Delta;G'&deg; attributed to the oxidation of NADH by O2 is -2∙F∙(0.82 - (-0.32)) = -220 kJ/mol.
	  		eQuilibrator provides the same result for this reaction: <a href="/search?query=NADH+%2B+0.5+O2+%3C%3D%3E+NAD%2B+%2B+H2O">NADH + &frac12; O<sub>2</sub> &rlhar; NAD<sup>+</sup> + H2O</a>.
	        </p>
	        
	        <p>
	        Currently, eQuilibrator only deals with soluble compounds, and therefore all electron carriers can be handled via their formation energies,
	        without the need to explicitly specify their redox potentials. The reduced and oxidized forms of these electron carriers are two distinct
	        chemicals and each is treated as a separate entity in eQuilibrator. For example, oxidized FMN and reduced FMN. In some cases, the formation
	        energy of the redox pair is unknown and we know only the difference between the formation energies of the two forms. In these situations,
	        the oxidized form is typically defined to have a formation energy of 0 and the reduced form has a value which is relative to that
	        (as is the case with FMN). These relative formation energies are equivalent reduction potentials.
	        </p>
	        
	        <p><strong>Update</strong>: eQuilibrator now supports half-reactions. You can search for a half-reaction like 
	        <a href="/search?query=NAD%2B+<%3D>+NADH">NAD<sup>+</sup> &rlhar; NADH</a> and eQuilibrator will allow you to calculate its reduction potential.
	        Calculating the reduction potential enables you to pair half-reactions with redox carriers not found in our database, including electrodes
	        and soluble metal ions with known reduction potentials.
